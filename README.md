## Viewing and Use

I advise to use the [AQA Assembly Language Simulator by Peter Higginson](https://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/AQA/)

Import my programs via the "LOAD" button and go!

And to better understand the commands, read this [documentation](https://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/AQA/info.html)

## Fibonnaci Sequence
[Here](https://bit.ly/3LO3lgW) is a pdf report of the code (in French)
- Program that calculates the sequence of "n" numbers (given in input) of the Fibonacci sequence by saving them from memory address 100.
- Registers R0, R1 and R2 are the registers used for the calculations of the sequence and whose results are directly stored in the memory by the command “STR”.
- Register R3 is the memory address counter, it starts at address 102 because there are first 0 and 1 which are the starting values of the registers.  

## Adder Sequence
[Here](https://bit.ly/3DRLQJY) is a complete report in pdf of the code (in French).
- Program that calculate the sum of the first n integers (1+2+3+4+5+...+n)
